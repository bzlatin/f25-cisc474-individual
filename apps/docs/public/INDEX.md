# LMS Project Docs Index

Vision: To create a flexible, user-friendly, and scalable Learning Management System that empowers learners, instructors, and administrators by providing a structured yet adaptable environment for managing programming problems structured around courses, assignments, submissions, and feedback. The LMS will support diverse learning needs, streamline administrative processes, and foster meaningful engagement between all roles in the system.

> **Unique submission type**: **Notebook File Upload** — Students can submit Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) as part of file uploads. The LMS stores the notebook, flags it with a “Notebook” badge in the UI, and makes it available for instructors to download and review. Notebooks are **not executed** in this prototype.

## Required Pieces

1. **Requirements (User Stories)** — [/apps/docs/public/requirements.md](./requirements.md)
2. **Site Map (Frontend pages)** — [/apps/docs/public/sitemap.md](./sitemap.md)
3. **Wireframes (Major screens)** — [/apps/docs/public/wireframes.md](./wireframes.md)
4. **Basic Data Model Diagram** — [/apps/docs/public/data-model.md](./data-model.md)

If any item maps to multiple artifacts, the mapping is described inside each file.

## How to Use

- Keep all files in `apps/docs/public/`.
- Diagrams use **Mermaid** blocks so they render natively on GitHub.
- You can copy these directly into your repo. Links above are relative and will work when committed at the same path.

## Note:

- This project was created with support from AI-assisted development tools to accelerate coding and design.
